I. Reading the data
```{R}
dmd_apnoea <- read_table("dmd-apnoea.txt")
View(dmd_apnoea)
```


II. Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Verify that you can reproduce Figure 1 of the paper. Make a version of this plot that is easier to read, perhaps by producing separate plots for different subtype/hypoventilation status.

Reproduce the original plot:
```{R}
# Plot the data: Scatter plot of age versus AHI
dmd_apnoea %>%
  filter(hypo != -99) %>% 
  mutate(hypo = as.factor(hypo)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = ageyears,
        y = ahi,
        shape = type,
        colour = hypo)) +
  geom_point(size = 1, stroke = 2) +
  labs(title = "Figure 1: Scatter plot of age versus AHI",
       x = "Age (Yrs)",
       y = "AHI (Events/hr)") +
  # shape: 5 for BMD, 0 for CMD, 1 for DM, 4 for DMD, 3 for LGMD
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(5, 0, 1, 4, 3)) +
  # colour: blue for 0, red for 1
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("cornflowerblue", "brown3")) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=3/4)
```

Easier to read version:
1) Separate plots for different subtypes
```{R}
# Plot the data: Scatter plots of age versus AHI
# Separate plots for BMD, CMD, DM, DMD, LGMD
dmd_apnoea %>%
  filter(hypo != -99) %>% 
  mutate(hypo = as.factor(hypo)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = ageyears,
        y = ahi,
        shape = type,
        colour = hypo)) +
  geom_point(size = 1, stroke = 1) +
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of age versus AHI\nfor different subtypes",
       x = "Age (Yrs)",
       y = "AHI (Events/hr)") +
  facet_wrap(~type) +
  # shape: 5 for BMD, 0 for CMD, 1 for DM, 4 for DMD, 3 for LGMD
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(5, 0, 1, 4, 3)) +
  # colour: blue for 0, red for 1
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("cornflowerblue", "brown3")) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=3/4)
```

2) Separate plots for different hypoventilation status
```{R}
# Plot the data: Scatter plots of age versus AHI
# separate plots for hypo = 1 and hypo = 0
dmd_apnoea %>%
  filter(hypo != -99) %>% 
  mutate(hypo = as.factor(hypo)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = ageyears,
        y = ahi,
        shape = type,
        colour = hypo)) +
  geom_point(size = 1, stroke = 1) +
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of age versus AHI\nfor different hypoventilation status",
       x = "Age (Yrs)",
       y = "AHI (Events/hr)") +
  facet_wrap(~hypo) +
  # shape: 5 for BMD, 0 for CMD, 1 for DM, 4 for DMD, 3 for LGMD
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(5, 0, 1, 4, 3)) +
  # colour: blue for 0, red for 1
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("cornflowerblue", "brown3")) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=3/4)
```

3) Separate plots for different subtypes and hypoventilation status
```{R}
# Plot the data: Scatter plots of age versus AHI
# separate plots for hypo = 1 and hypo = 0
dmd_apnoea %>%
  filter(hypo != -99) %>% 
  mutate(hypo = as.factor(hypo)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = ageyears,
        y = ahi,
        shape = type,
        colour = hypo)) +
  geom_point(size = 1, stroke = 1) +
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of age versus AHI\nfor different subtypes and hypoventilation status",
       x = "Age (Yrs)",
       y = "AHI (Events/hr)") +
  facet_grid(type ~ hypo) +
  # shape: 5 for BMD, 0 for CMD, 1 for DM, 4 for DMD, 3 for LGMD
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(5, 0, 1, 4, 3)) +
  # colour: blue for 0, red for 1
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("cornflowerblue", "brown3")) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 11) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=3/4)
```

2. Produce tables showing the mean and standard deviation of AHI for each disease subtype.

```{R}
# Table of mean and standard deviation of AHI for each disease subtype
dmd_apnoea %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarise(mean_AHI = sprintf("%.2f", mean(ahi, na.rm = TRUE)),
            sd_ahi = sprintf("%.2f", sd(ahi, na.rm = TRUE))) %>%
  datatable()
```


3. Make a histogram of the distribution of AHI

```{R}
# Histogram of AHI
dmd_apnoea %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ahi)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "cornflowerblue", colour = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of AHI",
       x = "AHI (Events/hr)",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=3/4)
```

III. Linear model for AHI
4. Fit a linear model ahi ~ ageyears + type and evaluate the residual plots. Comment on your conclusions.

```{R}
# Fit a linear model ahi ~ ageyears + type
lm_ahi <- lm(ahi ~ ageyears + type, data = dmd_apnoea)
summary(lm_ahi)

# Residual plots
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(lm_ahi)
```

Comment on your conclusions:
- From model summary, ...
- From Residual vs Fitted Values plot, ...
- From Q-Q plot of standard residuals, ...
- From Scale-Location plot, ...
- From Residuals vs Leverage plot, ...

5. Assuming a linear model is reasonable, see whether there is evidence for differences in relationship beween ahi and age in different diagnoses.
