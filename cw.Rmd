I. Reading the data
```{R}
dmd_apnoea <- read_table("dmd-apnoea.txt")
View(dmd_apnoea)
```


II. Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Verify that you can reproduce Figure 1 of the paper. Make a version of this plot that is easier to read, perhaps by producing separate plots for different subtype/hypoventilation status.

Reproduce the original plot:
```{R}
# Plot the data: Scatter plot of age versus AHI
dmd_apnoea %>%
  filter(hypo != -99) %>% 
  mutate(hypo = as.factor(hypo)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = ageyears,
        y = ahi,
        shape = type,
        colour = hypo)) +
  geom_point(size = 1, stroke = 2) +
  labs(title = "Figure 1: Scatter plot of age versus AHI",
       x = "Age (Yrs)",
       y = "AHI (Events/hr)") +
  # shape: 5 for BMD, 0 for CMD, 1 for DM, 4 for DMD, 3 for LGMD
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(5, 0, 1, 4, 3)) +
  # colour: blue for 0, red for 1
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("cornflowerblue", "brown3")) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=3/4)
```

Easier to read version:
1) Separate plots for different subtypes
```{R}
# Plot the data: Scatter plots of age versus AHI
# Separate plots for BMD, CMD, DM, DMD, LGMD
dmd_apnoea %>%
  filter(hypo != -99) %>% 
  mutate(hypo = as.factor(hypo)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = ageyears,
        y = ahi,
        shape = type,
        colour = hypo)) +
  geom_point(size = 1, stroke = 1) +
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of age versus AHI\nfor different subtypes",
       x = "Age (Yrs)",
       y = "AHI (Events/hr)") +
  facet_wrap(~type) +
  # shape: 5 for BMD, 0 for CMD, 1 for DM, 4 for DMD, 3 for LGMD
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(5, 0, 1, 4, 3)) +
  # colour: blue for 0, red for 1
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("cornflowerblue", "brown3")) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=3/4)
```

2) Separate plots for different hypoventilation status
```{R}
# Plot the data: Scatter plots of age versus AHI
# separate plots for hypo = 1 and hypo = 0
dmd_apnoea %>%
  filter(hypo != -99) %>% 
  mutate(hypo = as.factor(hypo)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = ageyears,
        y = ahi,
        shape = type,
        colour = hypo)) +
  geom_point(size = 1, stroke = 1) +
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of age versus AHI\nfor different hypoventilation status",
       x = "Age (Yrs)",
       y = "AHI (Events/hr)") +
  facet_wrap(~hypo) +
  # shape: 5 for BMD, 0 for CMD, 1 for DM, 4 for DMD, 3 for LGMD
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(5, 0, 1, 4, 3)) +
  # colour: blue for 0, red for 1
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("cornflowerblue", "brown3")) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=3/4)
```

3) Separate plots for different subtypes and hypoventilation status
```{R}
# Plot the data: Scatter plots of age versus AHI
# separate plots for hypo = 1 and hypo = 0
dmd_apnoea %>%
  filter(hypo != -99) %>% 
  mutate(hypo = as.factor(hypo)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = ageyears,
        y = ahi,
        shape = type,
        colour = hypo)) +
  geom_point(size = 1, stroke = 1) +
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of age versus AHI\nfor different subtypes and hypoventilation status",
       x = "Age (Yrs)",
       y = "AHI (Events/hr)") +
  facet_grid(type ~ hypo) +
  # shape: 5 for BMD, 0 for CMD, 1 for DM, 4 for DMD, 3 for LGMD
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(5, 0, 1, 4, 3)) +
  # colour: blue for 0, red for 1
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("cornflowerblue", "brown3")) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 11) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=3/4)
```

2. Produce tables showing the mean and standard deviation of AHI for each disease subtype.
```{R}
# Table of mean and standard deviation of AHI for each disease subtype
dmd_apnoea %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarise(mean_AHI = sprintf("%.2f", mean(ahi, na.rm = TRUE)),
            sd_ahi = sprintf("%.2f", sd(ahi, na.rm = TRUE))) %>%
  datatable()
```

3. Make a histogram of the distribution of AHI
```{R}
# Histogram of AHI
dmd_apnoea %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ahi)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "cornflowerblue", colour = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of AHI",
       x = "AHI (Events/hr)",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=3/4)
```


III. Linear model for AHI
4. Fit a linear model ahi ~ ageyears + type and evaluate the residual plots. Comment on your conclusions.
```{R}
# Fit a linear model ahi ~ ageyears + type
lm_ahi <- lm(ahi ~ ageyears + type, data = dmd_apnoea)
summary(lm_ahi)

# Residuals:
#     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max
# -16.512  -5.076  -1.050   3.543  41.347

# Coefficients:
#              Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
# (Intercept)  16.49514    3.47593   4.746 7.09e-06 ***

# Residual plots
par(mfrow = c(2, 2), pin = c(3, 2.25))
# 3:4 aspect ratio
plot(lm_ahi)

```
Comment on your conclusions:
- Residual vs Fitted Values plot: The non-horizontal smoother line suggests the possible presence of non-linear relationships between predictors (age and type) and the response variable (AHI) that are omitted by the model.
- Q-Q plot of standard residuals: The residuals exhibit tails on the same side on the line, indecating skewness in the residuals.
- Scale-Location plot: The upward trend in the smoother line indicates heteroscedasticity, violating the homoscedasticity assumption of linear regression.
- Residuals vs Leverage plot: While a few points display high leverage or high residuals, none exhibit high Cook's distance, suggesting there are no influential points in the dataset.

5. Assuming a linear model is reasonable, see whether there is evidence for differences in relationship beween ahi and age in different diagnoses.
```{R}
# Fit a linear model with interaction term: ahi ~ ageyears * type
lm_ahi_inter <- lm(ahi ~ ageyears * type, data = dmd_apnoea)
summary(lm_ahi_inter)

# Residuals:
#     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max
# -13.964  -4.630  -1.235   3.198  41.267

# Coefficients:

# ageyears:typeLGMD  -0.22281    0.18137  -1.228   0.2223
# ---
# Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1

# Residual standard error: 8.191 on 94 degrees of freedom

# F-statistic: 3.494 on 9 and 94 DF,  p-value: 0.0009178


# ANOVA test for interaction term
anova(lm_ahi, lm_ahi_inter)

#   Res.Df    RSS Df Sum of Sq      F Pr(>F)
# 1     98 6520.5
# 2     94 6307.1  4    213.39 0.7951 0.5313
```
Goodness of fit and ANOVA test not significant:
- t-values for the ageyears:type interaction terms are not significant.
- Adjusted R-squared for the model with interaction terms is lower than the model without interaction terms.
- (Ignore Multiple R-squared as it increases with the addition of more predictors, even if they are not significant.)
- F-statistic for the ANOVA test is not significant.
Suggesting that there is no evidence for differences in the relationship between AHI and age in different diagnoses.


IV. Generalized linear model for AHI
6. Group together observations into approx 5-year age groups. Make a plot of the group means against group variances, using a log scales for both axes. By fitting a suitable linear model to the grouped data, explain why the data are consistent with a variance function of the form V (µ) = µ^2.
```{R}
# Group data into 5-year age groups & Calculate group means and variances
dmd_apnoea_grouped <- dmd_apnoea %>%
  mutate(age_group = floor(ageyears / 5) * 5) %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_ahi = mean(ahi),
    var_ahi = var(ahi)
  )

# Plot group means vs. group variances
dmd_apnoea_grouped %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_ahi, y = var_ahi)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", colour = "darkred") +
  labs(title = "Log Group Means vs. Log Group Variances",
       x = "Log Group Mean AHI",
       y = "Log Group Variance AHI") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=3/4)

# Fit a linear model to the grouped data
lm_grouped <- lm(log(var_ahi) ~ log(mean_ahi), data = dmd_apnoea_grouped)
summary(lm_grouped)

# Residuals:
#     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max
# -6.2094 -0.0483  0.5589  0.9554  1.5640

# Coefficients:
#               Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)  
# (Intercept)     -1.134      2.359  -0.481   0.6410
# log(mean_ahi)    2.122      1.071   1.980   0.0758 .
# ---
# Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1

# Residual standard error: 2.185 on 10 degrees of freedom
# Multiple R-squared:  0.2817,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.2099 
# F-statistic: 3.922 on 1 and 10 DF,  p-value: 0.07581

```
Goodness of fit not ideal:
- t-value for the log(mean_ahi) coefficient is significant within 10% level.
- Adjusted R-squared is not high.
- F-statistic is significant within 10% level.
If the data is consistent with the model, it suggests that V(μ) = e^(-1.13) * μ^2.12.

Try to improve the goodness of fit by merging the last age group with the previous one, as it has only 3 observations and is an outlier.
```{R}
# Group data into 5-year age groups & Calculate group means and variances
dmd_apnoea_grouped_merged <- dmd_apnoea %>%
  mutate(age_group = ifelse(ageyears < 55, floor(ageyears / 5) * 5, 55)) %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_ahi = mean(ahi),
    var_ahi = var(ahi)
  )

# Plot group means vs. group variances
dmd_apnoea_grouped_merged %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_ahi, y = var_ahi)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", colour = "cornflowerblue") +
  labs(title = "Log Group Means vs. Log Group Variances",
       x = "Log Group Mean AHI",
       y = "Log Group Variance AHI") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=3/4)

# Fit a linear model to the grouped data
lm_grouped_merged <- lm(log(var_ahi) ~ log(mean_ahi), data = dmd_apnoea_grouped_merged)
summary(lm_grouped_merged)

# Residuals:
#     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
# -1.3750 -0.2411  0.1453  0.3711  0.8405

# Coefficients:
#               Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
# (Intercept)     0.5795     0.8225   0.705  0.49890
# log(mean_ahi)   1.5926     0.3741   4.257  0.00212 **
# ---
# Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1

# Residual standard error: 0.7192 on 9 degrees of freedom
# Multiple R-squared:  0.6682,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.6313
# F-statistic: 18.12 on 1 and 9 DF,  p-value: 0.002121

```
Goodness of fit improved:
- t-value for the log(mean_ahi) coefficient is more significant within 1% level after merging the last two age group.
- Adjusted R-squared is higher after merging the last two age group.
- F-statistic is more significant within 1% level after merging the last two age group.
Suggesting data is consistent with the model, V(μ) = e^(0.58) * μ^1.59 ≈ μ^2.
From the plot, we can oberve that e^(0.58) * μ^1.59 is closer to μ^2 than e^(-1.13) * μ^2.12, in the range of group means and variances in the data, further supporting the hypothesis that the model with merged age grouped.


7. (*) Explore models for the relationship between age and AHI that better respect the properties of the data. Give a bootstrap confidence interval for the age effect in your preferred model. You may also wish to investigate e.g. differences by sex.
    The mean-variance relationship suggests using a Gamma GLM, although this is incompatible with the presence of zeros in the data. One approach could be to fit a quasi-GLM model for AHI, using only non-zero AHI observations. A hurdle model is another possibility.


V. Binomial GLM for severe sleep apnoea.
8. A patient is defined to have severe sleep apnoea if their AHI is greater than 10 events per hour.
    Determine the effect on the odds of sleep apnoea of a 10 year increase in age, with a confidence interval.
